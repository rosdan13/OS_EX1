Nothing.

ANSWERS:

Q1:

We analyzed the strace output of ./WhatIDo` to understand what the program is doing. Here's what we found:

Starting Up:
- The chmod command is executed with our arguments
- System loads needed libraries and sets up memory

Checking and Changing Permissions:
- Current file permissions are checked: st_mode=S_IFREG|0664 (rw-rw-r--)
- The program changes permissions using: fchmodat(AT_FDCWD, "./WhatIDo", 0764) = 0
- This changes permissions to 0764 (rwxrw-r--), which means:

-- Owner (first digit 7): read (4) + write (2) + execute (1) = 7
-- Group (second digit 6): read (4) + write (2) = 6
-- Others (third digit 4): read (4) only

Finishing Up:
- Program closes standard output (file descriptor 1): close(1) = 0
- Program closes standard error (file descriptor 2): close(2) = 0
- Exits with success code 0

A Tiny Summary;
The command `./WhatIDo` adds execute permission for the file owner while keeping the existing read and write permissions.
The file starts with permissions 0664 (rw-rw-r--) and ends with 0764 (rwxrw-r--).
This shows how chmod works in Linux - it takes our symbolic notation (+700) and translates it to the appropriate
 permission bits before applying the change through the fchmodat() system call.
